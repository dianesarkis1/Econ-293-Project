# ECON 293: Causal Inference Project

This repository contains the final project for ECON 293: Causal Inference, focusing on heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) and advanced causal inference methods.

## Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes various causal inference methodologies including:
- **AIPW (Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting)**
- **Causal Forests** for heterogeneous treatment effects
- **Honest Trees** for causal inference
- **R-learner** approaches
- **G-learner** methods

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: R with packages for causal inference (causalForest, grf, etc.)
2. **Data**: Use the replication dataset in `Replication_Dataset.dta`
3. **Analysis**: Run the R scripts in order of complexity (start with data preparation)

## Key Findings

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of modern causal inference methods in identifying heterogeneous treatment effects, with particular focus on [specific findings from your paper].
